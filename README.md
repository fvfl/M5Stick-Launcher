* Having an SD card is good for better experience, but not really needed. [SDCard Hat for M5StickCs](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6459069)
* You can learn more about how it works o [Launcher Wiki](https://github.com/bmorcelli/Launcher/wiki/Explaining-the-project).
* Where/How do I find Binaries to launch -> [Obtaining binaries to launch](https://github.com/bmorcelli/Launcher/wiki/Obtaining-binaries-to-launch)
* Now you can download binaries from [HERE!](https://bmorcelli.github.io/Launcher/m5lurner.html)
</details>

## Known Issues
* UiFlow 1 doesn´t work with Launcher.. it uses an old MicroPython distro, that uses an old ESP-IDF distro with lots os secrets that I couldn´t figure out.

## To-Do list
Things that needs to be done in next updates
     * [ ] LVGL for e-paper displays
